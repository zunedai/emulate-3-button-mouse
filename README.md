# emulate-3-button-mouse
This is a very small but handy script for artists who use tablets in order to conveniently switch between having emulate the 3 button mouse activated or deactivated so that other functions that require alt can be used.

To install, simply go to Edit > Preferences > Addons, click on install, navigate to where the file is located, and double click.

To use this, you need to be in 3D view, node editor, compositor or VSE. The button can be found in the View panel of the UI.
